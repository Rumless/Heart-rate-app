Pulse is commonly measured in beats per minute (BPM) and the pulse rate can be used to check overall heart health and fitness level. Generally a lower rate is better, but too low can be dangerous as well. The American Heart Association states the normal resting adult human heart rate is 60-100 bpm. 
The basal or resting heart rate (HRrest) is defined as the heart rate when a person is awake, in a neutrally temperate environment, and has not been subject to any recent exertion or stimulation (eg. stress or surprise). The available evidence indicates that the normal range for resting heart rate is 50-90 beats per minute. This resting heart rate is often correlated with mortality: all-cause mortality is increased by 1.22 (hazard ratio) when heart rate exceeds 90 beats per minute.
The maximum heart rate (HRmax) is the age-related highest number of beats per minute of the heart when reaching a point of exhaustion without severe problems through exercise stress.In general it is loosely estimated as 220 minus one's age, thus it generally decreases with age.
Heart rate reserve (HRreserve) is the difference between a person's maximum heart rate and resting heart rate. As a person increases their cardiovascular fitness, their HRrest will drop, and the heart rate reserve will increase. 

When I was working as a Certified Personal Trainer (CPT), going to school for a certification in Exercise Science, and also applying my interest in fitness to my own life , I discovered that various standard units of time can be employed to record ones pulse, with longer durations yielding more accurate results. However, it is crucial to meticulously track both the time and the pulse simultaneously. This can be especially difficult after very vigorous exercise. Further, the time it takes to both find a pulse AND watch the clock can result in a slowed heart rate and a skewed representation of actual results.
This realization sparked my desire to create a solution. Consequently, the objective at hand is to develop an application that effortlessly calculates heart rate in BPM, regardless of the recording duration. The user's involvement is simplified to locating their pulse and initiating the recording period by clicking the start button. Subsequently, they can conveniently click the pulse button each time they feel their pulse. Finally, by clicking the stop button, the recording time is promptly halted, enabling the accurate calculation of BPM based on the user's input.
As should be obvious, the formula for BPM is (pulse ÷ minute). Thus, recording the time elapsed in seconds would hypothetically simplify this calculation. 
it would then be (pulse ÷ (seconds elapsed÷60))
By implementing this user-friendly application, individuals can effortlessly monitor their heart rate and gain valuable insights into their cardiovascular health and fitness.
