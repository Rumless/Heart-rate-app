Pulse is commonly measured in beats per minute (BPM) and the pulse rate can be used to check overall heart health and fitness level. Generally a lower rate is better. 
The basal or resting heart rate (HRrest) is defined as the heart rate when a person is awake, in a neutrally temperate environment, and has not been subject to any recent exertion or stimulation (eg. stress or surprise). The American Heart Association states the normal resting adult human heart rate is 60-100 bpm. Resting heart rate is often correlated with mortality: all-cause mortality is increased by 1.22 when heart rate exceeds 90 beats per minute.
The maximum heart rate (HRmax) is the highest number of beats per minute of the heart when reaching a point of exhaustion through exercise stress. In general it is loosely estimated as 220 minus one's age, thus it generally decreases with age.
Heart rate reserve (HRreserve) is (HRmax -HRrest). As a person increases their cardiovascular fitness, their HRrest will decrease, and thus the heart rate reserve will increase. 
When I was working as a Certified Personal Trainer (CPT), going to school for a certification in Exercise Science, and also applying my interest in fitness to my own life , I discovered that various standard units of time can be employed to record ones pulse, with longer durations yielding more accurate results. However, regardless of the time used it is crucial to meticulously track both the time and the pulse simultaneously. Even one false or missed beat can dramatically alter your results. Unfortunately, tracking both can be especially difficult after very vigorous exercise. Furthermore, the time it takes to BOTH find a pulse AND watch the clock can result in an already slowed heart rate and a skewed representation of actual results.
This realization sparked my desire to create a solution. Consequently, the objective at hand is to develop an application that effortlessly calculates heart rate in BPM, regardless of the recording duration. The user's involvement is simplified to locating their pulse and initiating the recording period by clicking the start button. Subsequently, they can conveniently click the pulse button each time they feel their pulse. Finally, by clicking the stop button, the recording time is promptly halted, enabling the accurate calculation of BPM based on the user's input.
As should be obvious, the formula for BPM is (pulse รท minute). Thus, recording the time elapsed in seconds would hypothetically simplify this calculation. 
it would then be (pulse รท (seconds elapsed รท 60))
By implementing this user-friendly application, individuals can effortlessly monitor their heart rate and gain valuable insights into their cardiovascular health and fitness.
