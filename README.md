# Heart-rate-app
Pulse is commonly measured in beats per minute (BPM). When I was working as a Certified Personal Trainer (CPT), going to school for a certification in Exercise Science, and also applying my interest in fitness to my own life , I discovered that various standard units of time can be employed to record ones pulse, with longer durations yielding more accurate results. However, it is crucial to meticulously track both the time and the pulse simultaneously. This can be especially difficult after very vigorous exercise. Further, the time it takes to both find a pulse AND watch the clock can result in a slowed heart rate and a skewed representation of actual results.
This realization sparked my desire to create a solution. Consequently, the objective at hand is to develop an application that effortlessly calculates heart rate in BPM, regardless of the recording duration. The user's involvement is simplified to locating their pulse and initiating the recording period by clicking the start button. Subsequently, they can conveniently click the pulse button each time they feel their pulse. Finally, by clicking the stop button, the recording time is promptly halted, enabling the accurate calculation of BPM based on the user's input.
As should be obvious, the formula for BPM is (pulse ÷ minute). Thus, recording the time elapsed in seconds would hypothetically simplify this calculation. 
it would then be (pulse ÷ (seconds elapsed÷60))
By implementing this user-friendly application, individuals can effortlessly monitor their heart rate and gain valuable insights into their cardiovascular health and fitness.
